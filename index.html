      I started telling people I'm a writer about a year or so ago. Before that, I told them I was an aspiring writer. The difference: the aspiring writer aspires to some day write, but likely isn't currently doing any writing. The writer writes. It's that simple. To be a writer, you have to write. You don't have to be good, you just have to write. Reading doesn't hurt either, but we'll pass over that for now...

      I'm going to guess that a lot of you are already aspiring writers. You probably have a story that is so unique and maybe tragic, or hilarious, or unbearably awkward, but the point is that you have a story. And humans are social creatures. They feel the need to share. Don't believe me, jump on <a href="https://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>. You don't have to be a writer to have a story. But you need to be one to write it down, and you become one when you start writing. So why not start today?

      Comparison to similar site

    <p><strong><a href="http://short-story.me/">Short-story.me</a></strong>:<br>
    
     It's good in that it provides useful information right from the get-go. You see a section in the top middle that briefly explains and markets the site. On the left, you have a way to sign up, and below that you have stories by genre. From being on this home page, you have a feel for what's on the site and a good idea of how to get there via the provided links. What is bad about it is that it is clunky or boxy. It looks very 90's-ish with the style. Most sites I see these days are more fluid. I don't have the proper coding terminology to explain this other than 90's-ish.

      Skipping all the stuff I don't understand nested within the head tags, I recognize a lot of the elements she includes in her site: div(lots of these), table, a, p, h1. I don't recognize the span or script elements. From a quick look-up on MDN, I see that span is the in-line version of div. But like divs, it recommends to stay away from using these unless there are no other appropriate semantic elements you can use in their place. The script element is used to embed a scripting language into the code, which can make the site interactive or do things that HTML can't do on its own.
