      I started telling people I'm a writer about a year or so ago. Before that, I told them I was an aspiring writer. The difference: the aspiring writer aspires to some day write, but likely isn't currently doing any writing. The writer writes. It's that simple. To be a writer, you have to write. You don't have to be good, you just have to write. Reading doesn't hurt either, but we'll pass over that for now.

      I'm going to guess that a lot of you are already aspiring writers. You probably have a story that is so unique and maybe tragic, or hilarious, or unbearably awkward, but the point is that you have a story. And humans are social creatures. They feel the need to share. Don't believe me, jump on <a href="https://www.facebook.com">facebook</a>. You don't have to be a writer to have a story. But you need to be one to write it down, and you become one when you start writing. So why not start today?
